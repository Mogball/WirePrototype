##Introduction
Wire will be a service that emulates cash transactions. At the most basic level, Wire will match the properties of cash transactions. That is to say, Wire will simplify people’s way of paying for goods and service, alleviate users from the burden of carrying cash, and saves users from the complexity of a banking system.
